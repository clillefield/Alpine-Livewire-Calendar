# Alpine-Livewire-Calendar
This is a very simple month calendar to use in Laravel.  It is built with Alpinejs and Livewire.  Sortablejs is also used to drag and drop events.  
Multiple day events are not supported at this time.
If anyone smarter and more experienced would like to collaborate on this project please due.
